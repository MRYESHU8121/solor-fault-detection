# solor-fault-detection
project on solor panal fault dectection using machine learning model 

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model for detecting faults in solar panels. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical performance data and then used to predict the fault status of new data points. The goal of this project is to improve the reliability and performance of solar panels by detecting faults early on, before they become more serious and expensive to repair.

download the dataset and perform EDA and build a machine learning model
